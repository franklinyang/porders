11/30/2015,1,Sean Pinata,0,0,0,0,0,48x24x12,"I want a pinata of my friend Sean. He is the person on the left with the blonde hair. Kind of tall and lanky. I'd like it to be in a sort of golf outfit, so here's how I envision the details: tan pants; brown shoes and belt; and, light blue golf shirt. Then I'd like the his name ""SEAN"" written in black across his chest just so it's clear. By shoes I just meant whatever you paint his feet. And I'd like the font over the entire chest in big block letters - that way it is clear to other people who the pinata is. TW",$24.50,12/3/2015,12/23/2015
